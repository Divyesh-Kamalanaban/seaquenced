### **Project Name: Sea-quenced ðŸŒŠ**

## **Project Overview**

The deep ocean holds a vast and largely undiscovered portion of global biodiversity. Traditional methods for studying it are slow, resource-intensive, and fail to identify new species. **Sea-quenced** is an AI-driven pipeline designed to overcome these challenges, providing a complete, end-to-end platform for identifying eukaryotic taxa and assessing biodiversity from environmental DNA (eDNA) datasets.

## **Core Features & Innovation**

### **Hybrid AI Pipeline: The Core Innovation**
Our core innovation is a hybrid approach that combines **deep learning** with **unsupervised learning**. Instead of relying on a single method, our pipeline uses multiple, purpose-built AI models that work in a sequence to deliver comprehensive results. 

### **Unsupervised Discovery (Autoencoder + DBSCAN)**
This is our most unique feature. A conceptual **Autoencoder** transforms raw DNA sequences into a low-dimensional "latent space." We then apply **DBSCAN** to this latent space to automatically cluster sequences. This enables the discovery and grouping of **novel taxa** that do not exist in any reference databaseâ€”a task traditional methods cannot perform. This feature is crucial for true scientific discovery.

### **Supervised Classification (CNN)**
For the clusters of known species, a conceptual **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is used to perform high-resolution taxonomic classification. The CNN is trained on a labeled dataset to recognize specific genetic patterns, assigning a name and a confidence score to each identified species.

### **Comprehensive Biodiversity Reports**
The pipeline integrates the outputs from both the supervised and unsupervised stages to generate a full biodiversity report. This report not only lists known species but also prominently features the newly discovered taxa, along with ecological metrics and a visual dendrogram showing the relationships between them.

## **Future Scope & Viability**

**Sea-quenced** is designed to be a scalable and viable long-term solution.

### **Seamless Transition to Real-World Data**
Our prototype uses synthetic data, but the pipeline is built to be seamlessly integrated with real-world datasets from repositories like NCBI's SRA. This roadmap for real-world application shows the project's viability.

### **Advanced Model Integration**
For a production-level version, we would replace the conceptual CNN with a pre-trained **Transformer model** like **DNABERT**. This would dramatically increase the model's performance and accuracy, as it can be fine-tuned with a small, specialized dataset without requiring extensive training from scratch.

### **Broader Impact**
This project has the potential to become the de facto standard for deep-sea eDNA analysis, enabling faster scientific discovery and more informed conservation strategies. The ability to monitor biodiversity in real-time could be a game-changer for protecting our most vulnerable marine ecosystems.
